# Debugging-NY-Times-library
This is a web scrapping project and I am trying to gather info from NY Times using APIs

In this project I am trying to gather more info from the Web APIs offered by one of the top most news media agencies - New York times.

The idea is to collect more data in semi-structured form (JSON) and then do some sort of analayis on it and comparison between different type of news articles.
